# Employees-CVS-Project

Written by James Philip on 20/03/2020

This project reads 10,000 employee records from a CVS file and creates subsequent employee objects. The objects were assigned their 10 corresponding attributes and stored in a hashmap. This data is then uploaded to a selfmade SQL database through a driver connection. The upload speed to the database was enhanced with use of threads.
